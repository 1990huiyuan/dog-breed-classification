# dog-breed-classification
This project is part of the projects in Udacity Deep Learning Nanoprogram. It involves the application of human detector, train your own dog detector and apply pre-trained dog detector (choose the desired architecture, in this case, VGG 16) to recognize dog/human and dog breed for the given picture. The data are from Udacity.
